/**
 * The LAndCommand class implements the {@link Command} interface and represents the long64 bitwise AND (`&`) operation command.
 * This class performs a long64 bitwise AND operation in the virtual machine by popping the top two values from the stack,
 * computing their long64 bitwise AND operation, and then pushing the result back onto the stack. It is a basic operation command within the virtual machine.
 *
 * <p>Specific behavior:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Pops two operands from the virtual machine stack.</li>
 *     <li>Performs the long64 bitwise AND (`&`) operation.</li>
 *     <li>Pushes the result back onto the virtual machine stack.</li>
